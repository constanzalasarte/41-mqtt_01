#   Project 41-mqtt_01

## Team: Valentina Isabella Valenzi, Francisco Luca Cavallaro, Catalina Ghiglione y Constanza Lasarte

##  First example of MQTT with ESP32

    A board with 3 external LEDs, 1 internal LED and 1 tact pushbutton using MQTT broker
    The 4 LEDs are toggled and lit by subscription and the pushbutton closure is published (and also can be subscribed to)
    It has 2 bit for enumeration so it may be connected till 4 boards with the same program to the same broker
